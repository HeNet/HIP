# HeNet B.V. / LongAP
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary
HeNet B.V. is a new subsidiary of Velorum B.V., a company from the Netherlands that specializes in security solutions with the main focus on cryptography.
We have developed the **LongAP One** Helium Gateway.
**LongAP One** is based on commonly and readily available components that have been used for years at large scale in various appliances. 

## Company Information

Velorum B.V. is founded by @timcooijmans and @bas-vk in 2018. HeNet B.V. is a newly founded subsidiary for building our **LongAP One** Helium Gateway. 
With Velorum B.V. we primarily focus on building solutions and helping corporates in the area of security, cryptography, and blockchain. @timcooijmans has 
been developing hardware and software-based crypto-solutions for over 10 years and @bas-vk has previously worked on the Ethereum blockchain at EthDev. 
We have done projects where we had 100s of devices in the field managed by us and operated over our own MVNO mobile network. 

## Product Information
### LongAP One
**Status**: Fully functional production sample.

**Expected release date**: Q2-Q3 2021

**Estimated price**: 600 EUR.

We have developed Helium Gateway around an industry-grade reliable platform that has been used in many routers and other solutions for over 5 years. 
It's fully based on x64-hardware with reliable products such as Intel-interface-chips and MLC SSD storage. 

**Specs**:
- AMD GX-412TC 1.0 GHz x64 Quad-core
- 2 GB of DDR3 RAM
- 30GB of MLC SSD storage
- Intel i210/211AT LAN interfaces (LAN/WAN and management)
- Intel 7260 WiFi b/g/n/ac + Bluetooth interface
- SX1301/SX1308 LoRa concentrator
- +3dBi LoRa antenna
- ATEC608A security-chip for hardware-bound key storage and operations. 
- 3 LEDs for connectivity-status indication
- Button for entering/leaving setup-mode and full-reset
- 12V DC-plug adapter
- 5-10W power-consumption
- Fully metal case

We are considering providing a variant with 4G/LTE connectivity instead of WiFi/LAN. However, this only becomes interesting once mining is moved from the gateways
to validators.

## Customer Support

Support will be provided over e-mail and Discord and general troubleshooting will be available on our website. 

Full product warranty will be provided on **LongAP One** for 2 years for customers and 1 year for businesses. 

## Hardware Security

Our devices contain an ATEC608A security-chip for key-storage and cryptographic operations.
Keys are non-exportable ensuring a high level of security.
We are happy to provide a  **LongAP One** for audit and answer questions. 

## Manufacturing Information

The **LongAP One** is based on readily available components we have been using for several years with great success when it comes to reliability and stability.

## Proof of Identity

Will be submitted to Helium Inc and/or DeWi.

## Budget & Capital

We have enough funds available to produce 1000s of devices. This is eased by the fact that we don't have to manufacture a custom hardware platform. 

## Risks & Challenges

We have identified a number of risks and challenges:
- The readily available components come from different manufacturers causing potential supply-chain challenges
- While we have experience producing and shipping devices, **LongAP One** may require us to scale-up to meet demand. 
- We are used to building and developing solutions for corporates and professionals, selling directly to consumers, and giving support to consumers of different skill level is new to us.
